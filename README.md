This project is being made to be used by my another project. My final goal is to make an open sourced robotic arm model, MeArm, to play chess with RasperryPi controller. 



To Do:

- Implementing alpha-beta search and evaluation
- Adding 50 move and 3 move repeat rules
- Promoting to other pieces rather than only promoting to Queen
- Move highlighting on GUI
- Lichess.com bot account


I made this project thanks to chessprogramming.org and the guides of Eddie Sharick on youtube. His channel is: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaEohRz5bPHywGBwmR18Qww


Opening polyglots of Flavio Martin, Titans were used.
syzygy endgame tables were used.

How to Open:
-Run chessgame.py on python.
-Press z to undo moves.
