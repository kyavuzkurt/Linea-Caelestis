This project is being made to be used by my another project. My final goal is to make an open sourced robotic arm model, MeArm, to play chess with RasperryPi controller. 



To Do:

- Adding 50 move and 3 move repeat rules
- Promoting to other pieces rather than only promoting to Queen
- Lichess.com bot account


I made this project thanks to chessprogramming.org and the guides of Eddie Sharick on youtube. His channel is: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaEohRz5bPHywGBwmR18Qww


How to Open:
-Run chessgame.py on python.
-Press z to undo moves.
-Press r to reset to board
-Change whitePlayer or blackPlayer parameters to True depending on which side you are playing
